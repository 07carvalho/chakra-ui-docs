The Accordion component is a multipart component. Read more about how to style
multipart components in the
[style system docs](/docs/styled-system/component-style#styling-multipart-components).

This component has four parts: `container`, `button`, `panel` and `icon`. You can find
more information in the source for the styles
[here](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/blob/main/packages/components/theme/src/components/accordion.ts).

## Example

The following theme would change the backgroundColor of the `container` and `panel` to `red.200` and `green.200` respectively, the fontWeight of `button` to `bold`, and the size of `icon` to `3xl`.

```jsx live=false
import { extendTheme } from "@chakra-ui/react";

export const theme = extendTheme({
  components: {
    Accordion: {
      baseStyle: {
        container: {
          bg: "red.200",
        },
        button: {
          fontWeight: "bold",
        },
        panel: {
          bg: "green.200",
        },
        icon: {
          fontSize: "3xl",
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

tags: ['principles']
---

Install Chakra UI in your project by running the following command in your
terminal:

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion

# or

yarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

After installing Chakra UI, you need to set up the `ChakraProvider` at the root
of your application. This can be either in your `index.jsx` or `index.tsx`

Put in the following code:

```jsx live=false
import * as React from 'react'

// 1. import `ChakraProvider` component
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function App() {
  // 2. Wrap ChakraProvider at the root of your app
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <App />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

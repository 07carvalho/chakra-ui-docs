## Introduction

Chakra UI provides components that help you easily layout sections and elements
of your web page or app. We call these components the Layout components.

Let's explore these components and see how they work.

### AspectRatio

The AspectRatio helps you dynamically modify the height of an element to match a
pre-defined width-to-height ratio. For example, a 4:3 ratio would enforce a
width of 400px and a height of 300px to an element. Use AspectRatio when you
want to keep the same width-to-height ratio across all screen sizes e.g to embed
responsive videos and maps.

A rule of thumb is to avoid using fixed width and heights on elements when using
the Aspect ratio.

### Box

Box is the fundamental component on which all other Chakra UI components are
built. Think of Box like the CSS `div`. It helps you create responsive layouts
with ease.

Whenever you use Box, you can pass in any style props such as `backgroundColor,`
`padding,` `margin,` and more.

You can also compose new components with the Box by using the `as` prop to
override the underlying HTML element.
